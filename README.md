# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression from scratch an example using houses prices prediction on a dataset from kuggle


first clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liorhameir/Linear-Regression.git
```

Then cd into the file
```bash
cd Linear-Regression
```

Then open cmd and run linear_model.py
```bash
python linear_model.py
```

The first graph shows the Eigenvalues of the $\sigma$ matrix, that correspond to the SVD:
X = U @ $\sigma$ @ V.transpose

The second graph shows the mean square error y - the response vector, and y_hat - the predicted vector.

the rest of the graphs are presenting the pearson correlation between every numeric features and the price
